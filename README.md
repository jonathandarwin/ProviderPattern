## Overview
<b>Provider Pattern</b> is another pattern design approach when building apps on flutter. We can say that this pattern is suitable for newbie in flutter because the concept is simpler than one of the famous pattern in flutter : BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern. In BLoC, we use Stream, Sink, Rx when designing our layout and business logic. Because of this, many newbie flutter developer feel confused when applied this pattern into their project. Provider pattern works similarly like DataBinding in android. It is not as same as the android, but we can take the concept from DataBinding to make us easier to understand what is going on in this pattern.
